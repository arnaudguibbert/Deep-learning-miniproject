README project 2 

The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only pytorch’s
tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the
neural-network modules.

## Getting started
Run test.py from the terminal.  
    
## The framework contains:  
* **utils.py** generates the data, and contains methods to train and test our framework.
* **framework.py** contains our framework. We first define classes containing activation functions, loss functions, linear layers. Then, we define
a class 'Sequential' similar to the 'sequential' attribute of PyTorch. Finally we define the class FrameworkModule, basically empty but acting as a more general framework for potential enhancements of the framework.
* **pytorchNet.py** contains a PyTorch implementation of the same model as the one we used in test.py
